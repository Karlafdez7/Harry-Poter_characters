# Harry Potter character finder
I present to you my first website made with **REACT**.

## Technologies used 💫

- VISUAL STUDIO CODE  🗄️
- HTML 📌
- SASS / SCSS  🕹️
- JS 🔗
- REACT🔗
- GIT / GITHUB 📂
- API🗄️
- GULP 🖌️

My previous knowledge in HTML, SASS, and JS has made it possible for me to work with REACT today. These three tools have been vital in building the page.

## What will you find in this project?

On this occasion, I have created an interactive page to get to know the most important characters in the Harry Potter saga.

But is that all? Of course not!

- You can search for characters by name,
- By the different Hogwarts houses in the saga,
- You can also filter by female or male characters,
- And if you're particularly interested in any of them, simply click to discover more information.

## To visualize this project:

- If you want to discover this project quickly and directly:
- Go to the "about" section and you will find the link that will take you to the page.

- But if you want to tinker a bit with the code:
- Feel free to download or clone the repository. Once you have it, open the terminal and all you need is an 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.
